    "\n",
    "### Perplexity:\n",
    "measures how “surprised” a language model is by a given text. Lower perplexity means the model assigns higher probability to the text\n",
    "> \t•\tLower scores indicate the model is better at modeling the style/content of your corpus. \n",
    "\t•\tExtremely low scores can also hint at overly safe or repetitive outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distinct:\n",
    "quantifies how many unique n-grams appear in the generated texts, relative to the total number of n-grams produced. It’s a simple diversity measure\n",
    "> \t•\tDistinct-1 measures word-level diversity (unigrams).\n",
    "\t•\tDistinct-2 measures phrase-level diversity (bigrams).\n",
    "\t•\tValues closer to 1.0 mean high diversity (few repeats)\n",
    "\t•\tvalues closer to 0 mean the model is repeating the same words/phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Self-BLEU:\n",
    "evaluates how similar the generated samples are to one another. It’s a reverse of BLEU: treating each generation as a “hypothesis” and all the others as “references.”\n",
    "> \t•\tScores range from 0 to 1.\n",
    "\t•\tHigher Self-BLEU means samples are very similar to each other (low diversity).\n",
    "\t•\tLower Self-BLEU means samples are more distinct.\n"

his friends, or fray his enimies:\\r\\nOf those he chose out two, the falsest twoo,\\r\\nAnd fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes;\\r\\nThe one of them he gave a message too,\\r\\nThe other by him

him in his slumber soft,\\r\\nA trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe\\r\\nAnd ever-drizling raine upon the loft,\\r\\nMixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne\\r\\nOf swarming

Hero the fair,\\r\\nWhom young Apollo courted for her hair,\\r\\nAnd offer\\'d as a dower his burning throne,\\r\\nWhere she could sit for men to gaze upon.\\r\\nThe outside of her garments were of lawn,\\r\\nThe lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;\\r\\nHer wide sleeves green, and border\\'d with a grove,\\r\\nWhere Venus in her naked glory strove\\r\\nTo please the careless and disdainful eyes\\r\\nOf proud Adonis, that before her lies;\\r\\nHer kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,\\r\\nMade with the blood of wretched lovers slain.\\r\\nUpon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,\\r\\nFrom whence her veil reach\\'d to the ground beneath;\\r\\nHer veil was artificial flowers and leaves,\\r\\nWhose workmanship both man and beast deceives;\\r\\nMany would praise the sweet smell as she past,\\r\\nWhen \\'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;\\r\\nAnd there for honey bees have sought in vain,\\r\\nAnd beat from thence, have lighted there again.\\r\\nAbout her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,\\r\\nWhich lighten\\'d by her neck, like diamonds shone.\\r\\nShe ware no gloves;
