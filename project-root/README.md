## Explanation of Each Component

Here's a breakdown of the purpose of each directory and file in this repository structure:

* **`project-root/`**: The top-level directory for the entire project.

* **`src/`**: Contains the core source code for the project.
    * **`data_loader.py`**: Script responsible for loading and preprocessing datasets.
    * **`model_runner.py`**: Script for loading trained models and performing inference (making predictions).
    * **`train.py`**: Script for training or fine-tuning models.

* **`utils/`**: Contains utility functions or scripts that are shared across different parts of the project.
    * **`helpers.py`**: Contains general helper functions.

* **`configs/`**: Stores configuration files for the models, experiments, or hyperparameters.
    * **`model_config.yaml`**: A YAML file to define model parameters, hyperparameters, and other configuration settings.

* **`outputs/`**: Dedicated directory for storing generated output from the models or experiments.
    * **`samples.txt`**: For text-based outputs, logs, or generated samples.

* **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploration, experimentation, or demonstrations.
    * **`demo_pipeline.ipynb`**: A notebook demonstrating the end-to-end pipeline or key functionalities.

* **`Dockerfile`**: Defines the environment for the project, specifying dependencies and how to build a Docker image for consistent deployment.

* **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the Python dependencies required for the project, allowing others to easily set up their environment using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

* **`README.md`**: A crucial file providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, how to run the code, and any other relevant information for users or collaborators.

* **`data/`**: Directory for storing datasets.
    * **`processed/`**: Specifically for cleaned and preprocessed data, differentiating it from raw data.
